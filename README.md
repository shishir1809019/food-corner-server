- In The Server side & Client side I have used - **MongoDB || Node || Express || React || React router || React Bootstrap || Material UI || Firebase || Firebase idToken || ContextApi || CSS & HTML**

- In the server side CRUD operation mainly focused.
- Here get , post, delete , put api was being used.
- By using this server user and admin can modify their data.

**Security**
- do not show secure links to those who should not see the links
- use jwt token: verifyJWT
- use verifyAdmin middleware
